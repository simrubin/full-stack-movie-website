#Fullstack Movie Website

This project was developed through a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org. It includes a Java backend with springboot, 
which handles the movie data and updates the review data to a MongoDB database.
The front end was built with React and includes basic functionalities like a carousel of movies,
the ability to watch the trailers of each movie and the ability to view and add reviews to each movie, which
updates in the database.
